        <h1>At Zion, visitors leave more than just footprints</h1>
        <h2>National parks became a popular destination during the pandemic, but tourists who wouldn’t normally visit are leaving graffiti, trash, and debris in their wake.</h2>

      <p><span>W</span>hile the pandemic virtually eliminated tourism last spring, visitor numbers at many national parks soared by summertime as travelers ditched cramped city quarantines for scenic road trip destinations. This year, many people are
        visiting national parks who would not normally have come but with the pandemic had few alternatives.</p>

      <p>Although land managers are glad that a broader and more diverse audience is connecting with national parks, crowds have wreaked havoc on invaluable protected lands, tagging ancient rocks and littering parks with their trash.</p>

      <p>Land managers say that the uptick in vandalism is driven by a lack of information about public lands and how to properly care for them, as well as chronic lack of funding and short staffing, which has only worsened during the pandemic with
        strict safety restrictions.</p>

      <p>The rise in Zion’s visitor numbers started accelerating in 2013, reflecting a nationwide trend. Before the pandemic, the park saw well over 4 million visitors annually. Last year started out strong before the pandemic hit, logging the
        highest numbers on record for January and February, respectively, before dipping in March and nose diving in April to just 40,000 visitors, a record low for the usually-popular month.</p>

      <p>While the park’s overall visitor numbers dropped substantially in 2020 as a result of the pandemic––by nearly 900,000, down to 3.6 million––the number of monthly visitors in September through December well exceeded those for the same months
        in 2019. In October, nearly 130,000 more people visited the park in 2020 than in 2019.</p>

      <p>The first three months of 2021 have already recorded record highs for each of the months of January, February, and March, respectively. Perhaps not fully vaccinated or still wary of air travel, many people are planning trips within the
        United States this summer, including state and national parks. Land managers expect visitor numbers to continue to break records as reservations for campgrounds and park tickets are already selling out.</p>

            <h2 class="text">HARMFUL IMPACT</h2>
            <p class="text">Graffiti degrades national parks from their original condition and tarnishes the experience for others. Vandalism of ancient petroglyphs and pictographs is especially pernicious, as those precious cultural resources have
              been there for thousands of years and can never be fully restored.</p>

          <div class="inner">
            <h2 class="text">INCREASE IN INCIDENTS</h2>
            <p class="text">There have been record-breaking numbers of visitors this year, with many first-time tourists coming from urban areas without much knowledge of national parks and how to protect them. Often, when one person leaves graffiti
              at a spot, more people add on to it and it catches on. Land managers have reported an increase in graffiti and vandalism recently, which has been especially difficult to cope with as many parks remain understaffed and underfunded.</p>

          <div class="inner">
            <h2 class="text">REMOVAL PROCESS</h2>
            <p class="text">Graffiti and vandalism can be extremely difficult, costly, and time-consuming to remove. Often, it’s impossible to restore ancient rock surfaces to their original state. If you see graffiti, don’t try to remove it
              yourself––it takes special skills and equipment to remove vandalism without causing more damage. Instead, report it to a ranger.</p>
